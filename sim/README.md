This do file contains several script constructs for customizing the colors
of a QuestaSim wave window. Simply altering the HEX color codes for the
specific color properties and re-importing the do file will alter the
color of the open QuestaSim wave window.

I tried adding some information to the script to indicate how to format
some of the property values. More property values can be found in the
Wave window under Tools -> Edit Preferences in the main window.
